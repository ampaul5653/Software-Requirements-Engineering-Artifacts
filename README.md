# Software-Requirements-Engineering-Artifacts

The Software Requirements Speciifcations document is the culmination of all the work in my Requirements Engineering and Analysis class. Over the course of 16 weeks, I crafted this document by constantly communicating with a real-world business. The SRS serves as a demonstration of all the business knowledge I gained, with the primary goal being to craft an SRS that's as close to one in the real-world as possible.

The Requirements Engineering Report is a hand-written report that demonstrates my knowledge of all four phases of the requirements engineering process: requirements elicitation, requirements analysis, requirements specification, and requirements validation. Each of these four stages has its own fully-detailed report.

The Software Requirements Tool Review was a wrap-up assignment with the following prompt:

"As part of a job interview, you have been asked to prepare about 10-15 slides using PowerPoint or Google Slides that showcases the benefits of Jira along with your personal experience and skill in using it. Your slideshow needs to speak for itself, you will not be presenting it. 

Describe the issues that are important in selecting a set of tools for requirements tracking. 
Demonstrate your capability to use software tools in support of the development of a software product of medium size. 

The target audience is a group of managers who are making a hiring decision for a junior software engineer and debating purchasing a subscription to Jira instead of using spreadsheets to document and manage requirements."

This assignment's primary goal was for us to demonstrate our knowledge of the tool we'd used to manage our personal projects all semester, Jira.
